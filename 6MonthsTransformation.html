    <div class="container">
        <!-- Key 1 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 1: Clarity</h2>
            <p>You must be crystal clear about what you want. Fuzzy goals produce fuzzy results; sharp goals produce sharp results. Write this down: Clarity is power. When you're clear about what you want, the universe has an interesting way of helping you get it. Most people know what they don't want but aren't clear about what they do want. Tonight, take out a piece of paper and write down exactly what you want your life to look like 6 months from now. Be specific.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 2 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 2: Philosophy of Life</h2>
            <p>Your philosophy determines how you process what happens to you. It's not what happens that determines your future; it's what you do about what happens. Success is the natural consequence of consistently applying basic fundamentals. What's easy to do is also easy not to do.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 3 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 3: Power of Association</h2>
            <p>You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Over the next six months, constantly choose who you spend your time with. Increase your exposure to people who inspire you and decrease your exposure to those who tire you.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 4 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 4: Discipline of Documentation</h2>
            <p>Become a serious student of your own life. Keep a journal, track your progress, and document your insights. The slightest adjustment in your daily routine can dramatically change your life over six months.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 5 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 5: Power of Investment</h2>
            <p>Invest in yourself. Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune. Commit to investing in books, courses, seminars, or coaching over the next six months.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 6 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 6: Miracle of Incrementalism</h2>
            <p>Small changes consistently applied produce massive results over time. If you improve just 1% every day for six months, you'll be 180% better than when you started. Success is built on a thousand tiny decisions made correctly day after day.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 7 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 7: Power of Goals</h2>
            <p>Set goals that scare you a little bit. Break these big goals down into daily activities. Success is not about what you do occasionally; it's about what you do consistently.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 8 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 8: Power of Environment</h2>
            <p>Your environment will either inspire you or expire you. Over the next six months, consciously design your environment to support your goals. Clean your office, organize your home, and create a space that energizes you.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 9 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 9: Power of Standards</h2>
            <p>Your life will always move in the direction of your standards. Raise your standards in every area of your life. When you raise your standards, your life transforms.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 10 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 10: Power of Rituals</h2>
            <p>Your life is shaped by your daily rituals. Establish rituals that support your goals. Wake up an hour earlier every day, giving you 180 extra hours over the next six months.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 11 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 11: Power of Accountability</h2>
            <p>When you're accountable to someone, your performance improves. Find an accountability partner or join a mastermind group. Share your goals, report your progress, and celebrate your wins.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 12 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 12: Power of Recovery</h2>
            <p>Over the next six months, you'll face setbacks. The key is not to avoid setbacks but to recover quickly. Successful people get up one more time than they fall down.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 13 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 13: Power of Focus</h2>
            <p>Where focus goes, energy flows. Become laser-focused on your priorities. Don't major in minor things. Build habits that will serve you for life.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 14 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 14: Power of Celebration</h2>
            <p>Celebrate your progress, not just your achievements. Celebration fuels motivation. Study successful people and learn from their experiences.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Key 15 -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Key 15: Power of Contribution</h2>
            <p>Success without contribution is empty achievement. Find ways to add value to others' lives. The more value you create for others, the more valuable you become.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="footer">
        <p>Six months from now, you will surely arrive. The question is where. The answer depends on the decisions you make today and the actions you take tomorrow. Life doesn't get better by chance; it gets better by change. Take action now and make the next six months the best of your life.</p>
